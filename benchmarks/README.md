# Notes

Here you will find various instances of the {coverability,reachability between
sets of markings} problem for Petri nets and monotonic extensions. 

**Disclaimer**: It is the user responsability to ensure technique X is indeed applicable to example Y (e.g. backward on a reachability problem is fine but ic4pn on a reachability problem is not). The tool might crash or --- even worse --- silently return incorrect results when the technique is not applciable.
