mist
====

Safety checker for Petri Nets (and some extensions)


Compilation
-----------

To compile:
   './configure'
   'make'

You can optionally install the package (in /usr/local/bin) with
root privileges:
   'make install'

To uninstall:
   'make uninstall'


Execution
---------

The runnable file are in 	src/:
	src/mist

Running:
	mist --\<algorithm\> \<input_file\>


Context
-------

mist provides a set of functions together with a data structure (IST that
stands for Interval Sharing Tree) to manipulate interval constraints in a
multi-dimensional space.  Additionnaly to the traditional operations on sets,
some operations are specialized to verification of MTNs (an extension of the
Petri Net formalism). MTN is a infinite state model for finite abstraction of
Java multi-threaded programs. In fact, each thread can be viewed as a finite
automata for which an abitrary number of instances can be considered.
