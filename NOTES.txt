I have some doubts about the output given by the tool and, as the info is written in french I can't deal so much with it.

There are some results which I think are wrong acorrding to the table: http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/ssd/ggeeraer/eec/tableau/

	* The example 'Java' should be not safe in the table but when I execute the tool with it the output says:
		"EEC concludes safe with the abstraction"
		"backward algorithm concludes unsafe"
		"TSI concludes safe"
		- ic4pn is the option executed default

	* There are so many examples that throws an error:
		"Cannot assign non null value to a variable in transition 'x'"
			-MOESI
			-last-in-first-served
			-german-protocolo
			-berkeley
			-dragon
			-futurebus
			-illinois
		The problem is the same fot each algorithm applied

	* Segmentation fault:
		-fms backward
		-kanban backward
		-newrtp backward
		-firefly tsi

	* The examples 'german', 'consprod', 'delegatebuffer', 'examplelea', 'transthesis', should be  safe but the results obtained by the tool are:
		"EEC concludes unsafe"
		"backward algorithm concludes safe"
		"TSI concludes unsafe"


	* The example 'simplejavaexample' should be unsafe but the results are:
		"EEC concludes safe"
		"backward algorithm concludes unsafe"
		"TSI concludes safe"

	* The example 'kanban' should be safe but the results are:
		EEC keyboard interrupt (too long)
		"backward algorithm concludes unsafe"
		"TSI concludes unsafe"
